# Real vs Fake Image Detection Using ResNet50, Xception, and DenseNet121

This project is a deep learning application designed to classify images as either "Real" or "Fake" using three pre-trained convolutional neural network models: ResNet50, Xception, and DenseNet121. The app is built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for image upload and classification.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Classification**: The application uses three models (ResNet50, Xception, and DenseNet121) to classify each image. The final prediction is determined by a majority vote of the models, with the confidence score averaged across the models.
- **Single and Batch Image Prediction**: Users can upload a single image or multiple images for batch prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit, the application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and view the classification results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
